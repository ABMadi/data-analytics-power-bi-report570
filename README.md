# **Power BI Quarterly Sales Report for an International Retailer**
### **📊 Transforming Retail Data into Actionable Insights**
A **medium-sized international retailer** has approached us to enhance their **business intelligence** capabilities. With **operations spanning multiple regions**, they have amassed a significant volume of sales data from **various disparate sources** over the years. Recognizing the **value of data-driven decision-making**, they have decided to implement **Microsoft Power BI** to generate a **Quarterly Sales Report**.

## **🎯 Project Objective**
The primary objective of this project is to design a **comprehensive Power BI report** that provides **high-level insights for C-suite executives**, along with detailed analytics on **customer value, product performance, and store efficiency**. To achieve this, we have:
- Extracted and transformed **data from multiple sources**.
- Designed a **robust data model** using a **star-based schema**.
- Developed a **multi-page Power BI report** with interactive visualizations.

The report delivers:
- 📈 **A high-level business summary** for executives.
- 🏆 **Insights into highest-value customers**, segmented by **sales region**.
- 🔍 **Analysis of top-performing products**, categorized by **type vs. sales targets**.
- 🗺️ **A geographical map visualization**, showcasing the **performance metrics of retail stores** across various territories.

## **📢 Milestone Achievements**
In this milestone, we focused on data extraction, transformation, and model optimization.

### **1️⃣ Sales Table (Fact Table)**
The **Sales** table contains transactional order data and serves as the primary **fact table** in the model.
- **Data Source**: Connected to an **Azure SQL Database** and imported the `Sales` table using **Import mode**.
- **Data Cleaning & Transformations**:
  - Deleted the `[Card Number]` column for **data privacy**.
  - Split `[Order Date]` and `[Shipping Date]` into **separate Date & Time** columns.
  - Removed **rows with missing Order Dates** to ensure data integrity.
  - Renamed columns to follow **Power BI naming conventions**.

---

### **2️⃣ Products Table (Dimension Table)**
The **Products** table provides details about the products, including category, pricing, and weight.
- **Data Source**: Imported from **Products.csv** using **Get Data** in Power BI.
- **Data Cleaning & Transformations**:
  - Removed **duplicate records** based on `[Product Code]` to maintain **data uniqueness**.
  - Renamed columns for **clarity and consistency**.

---

### **3️⃣ Stores Table (Dimension Table)**
The **Stores** information is contained within the `data_analytics` table.
- **Data Source**: Connected to **Azure Blob Storage**.
- **Key Transformations**:
  - Standardized the `[Region]` column for **consistent spelling**.
  - Created a **Country** column based on **Country Code (GB, US, DE → Full Country Name)**.
  - Created a **Geography** column combining **Region and Country** (e.g., `"California, United States"`).
  - Renamed columns to follow **Power BI best practices**.

---

### **4️⃣ Customers Table (Dimension Table)**
The **Customers** table contains customer records from different regions.
- **Data Source**: Downloaded and extracted `Customers.zip`, which contained multiple CSV files.
- **Data Import Method**:
  - Used the **Folder** data connector in Power BI.
  - Applied the **Combine & Transform** option to **merge all CSV files** into a **single dataset**.
- **Data Cleaning & Transformations**:
  - Created a `[Full Name]` column by **combining `[First Name]` and `[Last Name]`**.
  - Removed **unnecessary index columns**.
  - Renamed columns for **clarity and consistency**.

## **🛠️ Power BI Data Model & Schema**
The data model is structured using a **star schema**, with the **Sales table** as the central fact table and **dimension tables** for products, stores, and customers. This schema optimizes **query performance** and ensures efficient data relationships.

### **🔗 Relationships**
| **Dimension Table**   | **Fact Table (Sales)**  | **Type**  | **Active**  |
|----------------------|----------------------|----------|-----------|
| **Products[product_code]** → **Sales[product_code]** | One-to-Many | ✅ |
| **Data_Analytics[store code]** → **Sales[Store Code]** | One-to-Many | ✅ |
| **Customers[User UUID]** → **Sales[User ID]** | One-to-Many | ✅ |
| **DateTable[date]** → **Sales[Order Date]** | One-to-Many | ✅ (Active) |
| **DateTable[date]** → **Sales[Shipping Date]** | One-to-Many | ❌ (Inactive) |

## **📊 Key DAX Measures**
| **Measure Name** | **Description** |
|-----------------|----------------|
| **Total Orders** | Counts total orders (`COUNTROWS(Sales)`) |
| **Total Revenue** | Calculates revenue by multiplying quantity and sale price |
| **Total Profit** | Computes total profit per product |
| **Total Customers** | Counts unique customers dynamically |
| **Total Quantity** | Sums total quantity of items sold |
| **Profit YTD** | Calculates **Year-to-Date (YTD) profit** |
| **Revenue YTD** | Calculates **Year-to-Date (YTD) revenue** |
