# Power BI Quarterly Sales Report for an International Retailer

## üìä Transforming Retail Data into Actionable Insights
A medium-sized international retailer has approached us to enhance their business intelligence capabilities. With operations spanning multiple regions, they have amassed a significant volume of sales data from various disparate sources over the years. Recognizing the value of data-driven decision-making, they have decided to implement Microsoft Power BI to generate a Quarterly Sales Report.

## üéØ Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to design a comprehensive Power BI report that provides high-level insights for C-suite executives, along with detailed analytics on customer value, product performance, and store efficiency. To achieve this, we have:

- Extracted and transformed data from multiple sources.
- Designed a robust data model using a star-based schema.
- Developed a multi-page Power BI report with interactive visualizations.

### The report delivers:
- üìà A high-level business summary for executives.
- üèÜ Insights into highest-value customers, segmented by sales region.
- üîç Analysis of top-performing products, categorized by type vs. sales targets.
- üó∫Ô∏è A geographical map visualization, showcasing the performance metrics of retail stores across various territories.

## üì¢ Milestone Achievements
In this milestone, we focused on data extraction, transformation, and model optimization.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Sales Table (Fact Table)
The Sales table contains transactional order data and serves as the primary fact table in the model.

- **Data Source:** Connected to an Azure SQL Database and imported the Sales table using Import mode.
- **Data Cleaning & Transformations:**
    - Deleted the `[Card Number]` column for data privacy.
    - Split `[Order Date]` and `[Shipping Date]` into separate Date & Time columns.
    - Removed rows with missing Order Dates to ensure data integrity.
    - Renamed columns to follow Power BI naming conventions.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Products Table (Dimension Table)
The Products table provides details about the products, including category, pricing, and weight.

- **Data Source:** Imported from Products.csv using Get Data in Power BI.
- **Data Cleaning & Transformations:**
    - Removed duplicate records based on `[Product Code]` to maintain data uniqueness.
    - Renamed columns for clarity and consistency.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Stores Table (Dimension Table)
The Stores information is contained within the `data_analytics` table.

- **Data Source:** Connected to Azure Blob Storage.
- **Key Transformations:**
    - Standardized the `[Region]` column for consistent spelling.
    - Created a **Country** column based on **Country Code** (GB, US, DE ‚Üí Full Country Name).
    - Created a **Geography** column combining **Region and Country** (e.g., "California, United States").
    - Renamed columns to follow Power BI best practices.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Customers Table (Dimension Table)
The Customers table contains customer records from different regions.

- **Data Source:** Downloaded and extracted `Customers.zip`, which contained multiple CSV files.
- **Data Import Method:**
    - Used the **Folder data connector** in Power BI.
    - Applied the **Combine & Transform** option to merge all CSV files into a single dataset.
- **Data Cleaning & Transformations:**
    - Created a `[Full Name]` column by combining `[First Name]` and `[Last Name]`.
    - Removed unnecessary index columns.
    - Renamed columns for clarity and consistency.

## üõ†Ô∏è Power BI Data Model & Schema
The data model is structured using a **star schema**, with the **Sales** table as the central fact table and dimension tables for **Products**, **Stores**, and **Customers**. This schema optimizes query performance and ensures efficient data relationships.

### üîó Relationships
| Dimension Table | Fact Table (Sales) | Type | Active |
|-----------------|--------------------|-----|-------|
| Products[product_code] | Sales[product_code] | One-to-Many | ‚úÖ |
| Data_Analytics[store code] | Sales[Store Code] | One-to-Many | ‚úÖ |
| Customers[User UUID] | Sales[User ID] | One-to-Many | ‚úÖ |
| DateTable[date] | Sales[Order Date] | One-to-Many | ‚úÖ (Active) |
| DateTable[date] | Sales[Shipping Date] | One-to-Many | ‚ùå (Inactive) |
